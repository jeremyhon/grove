#### Key Libraries

- **CLI Framework:** [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) - The de-facto standard for building Node.js command-line interfaces.
- **Interactive Prompts:** [prompts](https://github.com/terkelg/prompts) - For user confirmations (e.g., on delete).
- **Terminal UI:** `chalk` (colors), `cli-table3` (tables), `ora` (spinners).
- **File Pattern Matching:** `glob` - For resolving file patterns like `.env*`.
- **Configuration Validation:** `zod` - For runtime validation of config files.

#### State vs. Configuration Design

We will separate **user-defined configuration** from **machine-managed state**.

- **Configuration:** Lives in `.grove-config.json` in your project. It's meant for you to edit and check into Git.
- **State:** Lives in `~/.grove/state.json`. It's managed by Grove, contains runtime data like port assignments, and **should not** be checked into Git.

#### Configuration & State Files

**Project Config:** `.grove-config.json`

```json
{
  "projectId": "proj_a8b2cde3", // Unique ID generated on init
  "project": "myapp",
  "basePort": 3000,
  "packageManager": "bun",
  "copyFiles": [".env*", ".vscode/"],
  "hooks": {
    "postSetup": "bun install"
  }
}
```

**Global State:** `~/.grove/state.json`

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "proj_a8b2cde3": {
      "basePath": "/path/to/project",
      "portAssignments": {
        "/path/to/project": 3000,
        "/path/to/project-feature-a": 3001
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  - [x] Add package manager detection and project ID generation.
- **Git Service (`src/services/git.service.ts`)** âœ…
  - [x] Create a wrapper around `Bun.$` to execute `git` commands and parse their output.
  - [x] Implement worktree management, branch detection, and repository validation.
- **Port Management Service (`src/services/port.service.ts`)** âœ…
  - [x] Manage the `portAssignments` section within `~/.grove/state.json`.
  - [x] Implement port conflict detection and cleanup of orphaned assignments.
- **File Service (`src/services/file.service.ts`)** âœ…
  - [x] Implement `copyFiles()` using `glob` and `Bun.write(target, Bun.file(source))`.
  - [x] Add project root detection and directory management using Node.js fs APIs.

#### 1.4. Testing & Quality Assurance âœ…

- [x] Add a corresponding entry for the `projectId` in the global `~/.grove/state.json`.
- [x] Auto-detect `packageManager` by looking for lockfiles.
- [x] Validate git repository and prevent double initialization.
- [x] Support verbose output for detailed initialization info.

#### 2.2. `grove setup` âœ…

- [x] Sanitize the feature name into a git-friendly branch name.
- [x] Orchestrate the setup flow using the core services: create worktree, assign port, copy files, run hooks.
- [x] Output only the target directory path to `stdout` for `cd $(...)` compatibility.
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and cleanup on failure.
- [x] Auto-assign next available port from base port.

#### 2.3. `grove list` âœ…

- [x] Fetch data from `GitService` and `PortService`.

- [x] Create `scripts/install.sh` for global Grove setup

**Note:** 
- `bun install` - installs npm package dependencies

- [x] Write integration tests that execute the compiled binary against a mock git repository.
- [x] Achieve comprehensive test coverage with 61 passing tests.
- [x] Test all core services: ConfigService, GitService, PortService, FileService, HookService, LogService.
- [x] Validate TypeScript interfaces and CLI command structure.

#### 4.4. Documentation
