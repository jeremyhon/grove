# Grove: Next Steps

## Phase 4: Distribution and Final Touches

### Build & Installation
- [ ] Create a release script to generate binaries for all target platforms
- [ ] Create `scripts/install.sh` for global Grove setup

### Shell Completion
- [ ] Leverage `commander`'s built-in support for shell completions
- [ ] Add a `grove completion <shell>` command that outputs the completion script
- [ ] The installer script will offer to automatically add the sourcing of this script to the user's shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`)

### Documentation
- [ ] Ensure `README.md` is comprehensive
- [ ] Rely on `commander`'s excellent, auto-generated help text for all commands
- [ ] Document the hook system and configuration options thoroughly
